;;; Commentary

;; For know, only some command for simple control of xmms2.

;; you can use xmms2-status to know what is playing and
;; xmm2-play/xmm2-toggle/xmm2-pause/xmm2-stop/xmm2-next/xmm2-prev to
;; control xmms2

;; Installing :
;; put this file in some direcories in your load path
;; add (require 'xmms2) to you .emacs

;; you can also add keybinding: for example, for my multimedia keys:

;; (global-set-key [<XF86AudioPlay>] 'xmms2-toggle)
;; (global-set-key [<XF86Back>] 'xmms2-prev)
;; (global-set-key [<XF86Forward>] 'xmms2-next)

;;; TODO
;; a mode to view/edit playlists
;; a mode to view/edit collection
;; a mode to view current status
;; maybe status bar integration
